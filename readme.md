Analysis of Treatment Quality and Efficiency of Hospitals

**Problem Statement:** The Objective of this research is to escalate the health care expenditure and the
number of hospitalizations.

**Data Source**: The health data for the study was extracted from the Statewide Planning and Research
Cooperative System (SPARCS) of the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH). We extracted
200,000 patient records for the period 2009 to 2012. Data from such a large dataset is naturally
characterized by a degree of incompleteness and fuzziness. The data includes the hospitalization
indicators such as **facility ID, procedure description, type of admission, patient disposition upon
discharge, APR severity of illness, source of payment, and age group.** The indicators for treatment result
include **Length of Stay** and **APR Risk**.
